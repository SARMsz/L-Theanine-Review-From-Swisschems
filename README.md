<h2>How I Tested and Ranked Swisschems L‑Theanine</h2>
<p>I tested this powder over four weeks. Each day I took 1 g before work, training, or study. I measured:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mixability</strong> – How well it dissolved in water or juice.</li>
  <li><strong>Onset time</strong> – Minutes until I felt calm focus.</li>
  <li><strong>Duration</strong> – How long effects lasted.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency</strong> – Batch‑to‑batch uniformity.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also asked three friends to try it during their <em>cutting</em> and <em>bulking</em> phases and collected feedback on anxiety reduction and sleep improvement.</p>

<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<p>Within 20 minutes of stirring 1 g into cold water, I felt a gentle calm settle in. My mind felt clear, and I could focus on sets without overthinking the next rep. I noticed:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sharper focus</strong> during bench press and squat sessions.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced pre‑workout jitters</strong> when stacking with caffeine.</li>
  <li><strong>Smoother sleep</strong> on rest days—no grogginess.</li>
</ul>
<p>My friends reported similar benefits. One friend on a <em>cut</em> said cravings felt easier to ignore. Another who was <em>bulking</em> noticed calmer mood swings.</p>
